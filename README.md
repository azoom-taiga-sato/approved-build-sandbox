4. Coder) Make a PR and ask a reviewer for their review/approval

5. *Reviewer) Approve the PR (*NOT merge it into the main branch at this point)

6. Coder) Update the version and create a new tag IN YOUR WORKING BRANCH and push again
    ```bash
    $ yarn version
    ðŸ‘‡
    yarn version v1.22.22
    info Current version: 1.0.3
    question New version: 1.0.4
    info New version: 1.0.4
    âœ¨  Done in 4.05s.
    ```
